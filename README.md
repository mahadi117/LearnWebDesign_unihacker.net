This is the repo for the Web Design Series I'm making. Hope it would help if anyone needs some in this field.

HTML - Structure of the webpage
CSS - Design of the webpage
JavaScript - Behaviour of the webpage.

HTML 
It is a markup language. Common for the all the browsers in the world. 
Have some basic syntax which is very easy to learn. 
Always stays inside tags </> with some exceptions.

<html>
<head>
<body>

Some of the common tags are:

<p> paragraph </p> 
<h1> Heading 1 </h1>                          // larger 
.
.
.
<h6>  Heading 6</h6>                          // smaller

<a href> anchor tag </a>
<div> for a particular area </div>            // very useful tag

<ol> ordered list </ol>
<ul> unordered list </ul>
<li> List in </li>

<img/> image tag  

HTML 5 is the latest version which has more advanced and better tag uses. 
<article> article </article>
<audio> 
<video> 



CSS, "Cascading Style Sheets"
It creates the basic design or layout of the page. It is on top of the HTML structure. 
It gives a better feel when you visit the web. 
<style> 

Understanding of Class and Div is a bit important.



JavaScript
It is the behaviour of the webpage. When we move the cursor we can make the items to change color or move or take us to another place. 
Or give some motion; this all done by JS.

<script>

Understanding of basic programming concepts is essential in this part.
