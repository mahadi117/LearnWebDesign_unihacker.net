This is the repo for the Web Design Series I'm making. Hope it would help if anyone needs some in this field.

<h2>HTML - Structure of the webpage</h2>
<h2>CSS - Design of the webpage</h2>
<h2>JavaScript - Behaviour of the webpage.</h2>

</h1>HTML </h1>
It is a markup language. Common for the all the browsers in the world. 
Have some basic syntax which is very easy to learn. 
Always stays inside tags </> with some exceptions.

<html>
<head>
<body>

<h2>Some of the common tags are:</h2>

<p> paragraph  
<h1> Heading 1                        // larger 
.
.
.
<h6>  Heading 6                          // smaller

<a href> anchor tag 
<div> for a particular area            // very useful tag

<ol> ordered list 
<ul> unordered list 
<li> List in 

<img> image tag  

HTML 5 is the latest version which has more advanced and better tag uses. 
<article> article 
<audio> audio tag
<video> video tag
But they need source.



<h2>CSS, "Cascading Style Sheets"</h2>
It creates the basic design or layout of the page. It is on top of the HTML structure. 
It gives a better feel when you visit the web. 
<style> 

Understanding of Class and Div is a bit important.



<h2>JavaScript </h2>
It is the behaviour of the webpage. When we move the cursor we can make the items to change color or move or take us to another place. 
Or give some motion; this all done by JS.

<script> script 

Understanding of basic programming concepts is essential in this part.
